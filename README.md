## Examples and Tutorials

### 1. Building a Simple Chatbot

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a basic chatbot using Python and a simple rule-based approach.

#### Steps:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Use the `requirements.txt` file to set up your environment.

2. **Create the Chatbot Logic**
   Write the logic for your chatbot. Hereâ€™s a simple example:
   ```python
   def chatbot_response(user_input):
       if "hello" in user_input.lower():
           return "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
       return "I'm sorry, I don't understand that."
   ```

3. **Run the Chatbot**
   Use a loop to keep the conversation going:
   ```python
   while True:
       user_input = input("You: ")
       print("Bot:", chatbot_response(user_input))
   ```

### 2. Training a Machine Learning Model

This tutorial guides you through training a machine learning model using scikit-learn.

#### Steps:

1. **Load Your Dataset**
   Use pandas to load your dataset:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
   ```

2. **Preprocess the Data**
   Clean and prepare your data for training.

3. **Train the Model**
   Use scikit-learn to train your model:
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

   X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
   y = data['target']

   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
   model = RandomForestClassifier()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

4. **Evaluate the Model**
   Check the accuracy of your model:
   ```python
   accuracy = model.score(X_test, y_test)
   print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
   ```

### 3. Implementing Large Language Models

This section focuses on using large language models like GPT-3 for text generation.

#### Steps:

1. **Set Up OpenAI API**
   Sign up for an API key from OpenAI.

2. **Install OpenAI Library**
   Use pip to install the OpenAI library:
   ```bash
   pip install openai
   ```

3. **Generate Text**
   Use the API to generate text:
   ```python
   import openai

   openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

   response = openai.Completion.create(
       engine="text-davinci-003",
       prompt="Once upon a time",
       max_tokens=50
   )

   print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
   ```
